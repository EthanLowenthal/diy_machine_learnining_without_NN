# diy_machine_learnining_without_NN
I used Pygame to crate pretty crappy machine learning without a neural network (becuase I dont know how to write on from scratch and I dont want to use some fancy package). You may notice that as the cars evolve, their scores acutally get worse. I have no idea why this is, but when I take the best cars and create a new generation they get a lot better, so eventually the cars did evolve to go through the track as fast as possibe wothout touchin the walls. This took about 6 hours of training (15 seconds/generation, 200 genrations before best cars were used to crate new generation)
```bash
python3 -m pip install pygame --user
```
